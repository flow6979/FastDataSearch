# FastDataSearch
FastDataSearch is like a high-powered search engine for your big data collections. Imagine you have massive csv file full of information, and you want to be able to find exactly what you need quickly and easily. That's where FastDataSearch comes in.

- FastDataSearch is built using Java Spring Boot.

- Here's what it does in simpler terms:
  
  1. It takes your large data files (like giant CSV spreadsheets) and cleverly organizes them in a special database called **Elasticsearch**. This is like creating a super-efficient filing system for your data.
  2. Once your data is organized, you can search through it really fast. It's similar to how Google lets you find things on the internet quickly, but for your own data.
  3. You can ask FastDataSearch questions about your data with query similar to SQL AND opertaion and it will fetch that information for you in a snap.
  4. It's smart about handling huge amounts of data. Instead of trying to work with everything at once (which would be slow), it breaks things into manageable chunks.
   
The big benefit is speed and efficiency. If you're a business dealing with tons of data, FastDataSearch helps you find what you need without waiting around. It's like having a super-fast, super-smart assistant that knows exactly where everything is in your massive digital filing cabinet.
